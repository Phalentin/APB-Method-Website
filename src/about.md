# About this Book
Hi, I am [JustEnoughAlgorithms](https://www.youtube.com/@justenoughalgorithms) and I'm working on this because I want to get more people to use this method. This book is heavily inspired by the [zzmethod.com](https://zzmethod.com) website by [crystalcuber](https://www.youtube.com/@crystalcuber).
The purpose of this book is to be a learning resource for all levels of APB users, as well as to showcase this method to users of other methods like CFOP, Roux or ZZ. I've been maining this method since autumn of 2023 and have since beaten all of my old PBs that I set with Roux.
This book is written using the rust-based [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)-utility.
