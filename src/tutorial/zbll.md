# ZBLL

ZBLL is the last and simultaneously the hardest step of APB. This set contains 493 algorithms. Good sources for ZBLL algorithms are:
- [**SpeedCubeDB ZBLL:**](https://speedcubedb.com/a/ZBLL) big selection of algorithms, but the top algorithm is often not the best one
- [**Teri's ZBLL:**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BiQZkCZvTDRlW6Y6jTBHXPPjZF9k55x8YJgXXs5nhCs/) really optimised algorithms, but getting the right fingertricks can be tricky. These algorithms require a lot of practice and might be riskier than you'd like.
- [**Juju ZBLL:**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uwmZHf4vwJxFgeB3-TiF8MQ0RFSS30d5CUK96PoIwk/) good algorithms that are used by a world-class ZBLL user. Sometimes there are better algorithms available.
- [**ZBLL Explorer:**](https://pepkin88.me/zbll-explorer/) big selection of algorithms, better ranking than SpeedCubeDB's, shows the relation between cases

I'd recommend learning the ZBLL subsets in an order similar to this:
1. U, T, L
2. Pi, H
3. Sune, Antisune

## Beginner approach to the last layer in APB
Until you've learned all of the ZBLLs, you should OCLL + PLL to solve the last layer. These algorithms can be found on SpeedCubeDB:
- [**OCLL (select "OCLL")**](https://speedcubedb.com/a/3x3/OLL)
- [**PLL**](https://speedcubedb.com/a/3x3/PLL)
