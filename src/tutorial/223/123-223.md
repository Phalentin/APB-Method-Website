# 1x2x3 → 2x2x3

The most common way of creating a 2x2x3 block at the start of the solve is by creating a Roux-style 1x2x3 block on the left side and then adding the DF and DB edges. 

## 1. Solve the 1x2x3
Since this step is identicall to the first block of the Roux method, there is already a lot of information about it on the internet. I'd recommend these two videos by Kian Mansour

## Ways of solving the 1x2x3
This list is not meant as a step-by-step explanation, it should give you some ideas about how you can create a 1x2x3 on your own.
- **White edge + two F2L pairs:** First you solve the white edge to its non-white center. Then you create the two adjacent F2L pairs and join everything together.
- **1x2x2 → 1x2x3:** You create a 1x2x2 block by building two 1x1x2 lines and joining them. Then you add the remaining F2L pair.
- **Line + Line:** You create a corner-edge-corner line and join it with an edge-center-edge line.
- **Pseudoslotting:** It is possible, even with APB, to build pseudo pairs to solve your 1x2x3. Keep in mind that it is impractical to keep the D layer misaligned further than the dBR pair creation though.

## Ways of solving DFDB edges
This video by Greg Cannon showcases different ways of solving the DF and DB edges.

There are two main ways of solving the DF and DB edges:
- **Solve edges to centers seperately:** You solve the centers relative to your 1x2x3 block. Then you put one of your edges into the U layer. You can now insert it with `r U2 r'` / `r' U2 r` or `r U' r'` / `r' U r`, depending on the orientation of the edge. Repeat that with the second edge.
- **Solve edges in relation to each other, then connect them with centers:** You first put both edges opposite of each other with the white face facing up using the rRU moveset. Then you put the center between those edges using M moves. Finally, you can align the edgeas to their corresponding colored centers and bring them down using r moves.
