The first step of APB is the creation of a 2x2x3 block in the bottom-left. This can be approached in multiple different ways, altough creating a Roux-style 1x2x3-block and then extending it is the best option most of the time.
## Ways of Creating the 2x2x3:
### 1x2x3 → 2x2x3:
This is the preffered and on most scrambles the most efficent way to create the 2x2x3. There are two ways to create the block in this way: Either you create the dL block first and then solve the other two edges or you create the Dl block first and then connect the left two edges. Because the first way is more intuitive, I'll explain it like that, but the other way is totally possible.
1. **Create the 1x2x3:** This can be done by connecting a white edge to its other colored center, then the two adjacent F2L-pairs can be solved. Note, that the block has to be made on the left side and you should not use any cube rotations during the whole solve, so you have to take advantage of wide r moves to build your F2L-pairs. Obviously, there are different ways of building a 2x2x3 block, but that can be explored in Roux tutorials.
2. **Extend to a 2x2x3:** At a beginner level, you should first match the centers in the M slice to the 1x2x3 block and then bring one of the two dM edges into the top layer. Depending on its orientation, it can be inserted with `r U2 r'` / `r' U2 r` or `r U' r'` / `r' U r`. At higher levels, this step is often done by solving the dM edges in relation to each other and then joining them with the white center using M moves.

### 2x2x2 → 2x2x3
This way can be really efficient if the scramble is good. During the whole process, make sure not to rotate.
1. **Create 1x2x2 square:** Either you create a Center-Edge-Corner-Edge square, or you create a Center-Edge-Center square,
2. **Join another 1x2x2 square:** You have to join one of the other type (if you made a CECE square first, you now have to join a CEC square)
3. **Join yet another 1x2x2 square:** This square needs to be a Center-Edge-Corner-Edge square.

### Three Cross Edges + Two F2L pairs
<div class="warning"><b>Warning:</b><br>This method should only be used if the scramble allows for an efficient solution with it. Do not solve the 2x2x3 like this by default.</div>

1. **Solve three cross pieces:** Solve the cross like you do with CFOP, but you leave out one of the edges. Ideally, you should orient the edges of the two F2L-pairs that you're going to solve in the next step at the same time.
2. **Solve two F2L pairs:** Solve the two left F2L pairs rotationless.
