LXS is the best step of the APB method. It is extremely fast and the recognition is super easy. Even though there are 116 algorithms, they are extremely easy to learn and many achieve to learn them within a few days. The algorithms can be found in [Athefre's sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/).

## Beginner Approach to LXS
If you haven't learned all of the LXS algorithms yet, you can solve these three pieces according to the following method:
1. Solve the DR edge by either putting it in UL and then doing `S R2 S' R2` or, if the edge is in FR, by doing `R' U' R' U R`.
2. Solve the remaining F2L pair intuitively or by using the *DR edge at DR* algorithms in [Athefre's LXS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/).

Do keep in mind that your goal should be to learn all of the 116 LXS algorithms. If you don't want to learn this many algorithms, use Roux or CFOP.
