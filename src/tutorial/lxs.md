LXS stands for Last eXtended Slot and it is the best step of the APB method. During this step, you solve the remaining three pieces in the first two layers algorithmically. LXS is extremely fast and the recognition is super easy. Even though there are 116 algorithms, they are really easy to learn and many achieve to learn them within a few days. The algorithms can be found in [Athefre's sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/).

## Beginner Approach to LXS
If you haven't learned all of the LXS algorithms yet, you can solve these three pieces according to the following method:
1. Solve the DR edge by either putting it in UL and then doing `S R2 S' R2` or, if the edge is in FR, by doing `R' U' R' U R`.
2. Solve the remaining F2L pair intuitively or by using the *DR edge at DR* algorithms in [Athefre's LXS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/).

Do keep in mind that your goal should be to learn all of the 116 LXS algorithms. If you don't want to learn this many algorithms, use Roux or CFOP.

## Learning LXS
LXS is much easier than you might expect. Contrary to algorithm sets like OLL, PLL or ZBLL, most of the algorithms are quite intuitive. Nevertheless, LXS should be solved algorithmically for better efficiency and turning speed.<br>
You should start with the cases where the corner is in the D layer (DFR, RDF, FRD). With these 26 algorithms (including 5 F2L cases) you can solve every LXS case with two steps:
1. **Insert Corner:** Insert the DFR corner using `R U R'` or `R U' R'`.
2. **Solve LXS case:** Solve the resulting LXS case.

This should make you more familiar with the LXS step.<br>
For easier learning, you can use [Liam Highducheck's LXS patterns sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACKQXpMK0b8RWGoN9wMDbnF-W-S4mMdeJH5IcjeEyf8/), which assigns each case to one of six groups.
