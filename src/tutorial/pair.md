The second step of APB is the creation and insertion of the back-right F2L pair. 
## Creating the pair 
Creating a pair is always possible using only `R` and `U` moves and no rotations (although sometimes there are better solutions with `F` moves). If you are unsure about how to solve a case, try putting the edge into the U layer and the corner in DFR or DFB so that the white sticker is on the right side. Then you can put the edge into UF or UB and then join it with the corner using R moves. <br>
## Inserting the pair
If the pair is oriented, you can just insert it using R and U moves. If it is misoriented however, you should put the pair on the right and insert it with `f R' f'`.
## Algorithmic solutions
At a higher level, this step can be done algorithmically. The algorithms can be found in [Liam Highducheck's sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1nwq_-HLeDgajuAOVRaH2Jo7X9zSTEBrnIRSv3hzeg). It is recommended to at least take a look at the harder cases when you feel like your solution is long. This is especially the case for cases with a misoriented edge, as there are often fast algorithmic solutions using the S slice. However, it's not worth it to learn all of the 89 algorithms, as it is also important to be able to come up with solutions yourself and it's smarter to use your time otherwise.
