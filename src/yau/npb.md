The NPB / APBig method was developed by V Sundararajan. The steps are:
1. **Solve two centers:** Solve two centers that are opposite of each other. They will be your U/D colors eventually, so you should probably pick white and yellow, unless you are fully color neutral. Put the centers at U & D.
2. **Solve two adjacent cross edges:** Pair two adjacent cross edges and join them to their center. Remember to put them in the right order. Hold the incomplete cross on the bottom
3. **Solve remaining centers:** Hold the partial cross on the L face at BL and DL, then solve the remaining centers using R, U and F moves.
4. **Create a 2x2x2 block:** Hold the cross on the bottom with the edges at DL and DB, then pair the required F2L edge using u and d moves. When it's paired, put it into the U layer and fix the centers. Finally, insert the edge with its corner into dBL
5. **Pair FL and FD edges:** Pair the FL and FD edges edge using u and d moves, put them into the U layer and restore the centers
6. **Solve the 2x2x3 block:** Solve the 2x2x3 block using the edges you paired in the previous step.
7. **Pair remaining edges:** Do a `y` rotation and pair the remaining edges like the 2-3 part in 3-2-3 edge pairing. For this you should use the RUuLF moveset.
8. **Solve the dBR pair:** Do a `y'` rotation and continue the solve with the dBR pair.
9. **OLL parity:** Check during EO recognition if you have OLL parity and correct it immediately.
10. **Solve the cube:** Solve the cube normally and do PLL parity at the end / before ZBLL if required.
