The Meyer method was originally developped for the Roux method, but since both Roux and APB (usually) start with a 1x2x3 block, this method works just as well with APB. A video explanation by Kian Mansour is below but note this small difference: At 8:38 minutes, Kian specifically creates the edge belonging into DR. With APB you either just make any edge, or the one belonging into DB for easier look-ahead into 3x3 stage. Alternatively, you can read the text explanation below.

1. **Solve two centers:** Solve two centers that are opposite of each other. They will be your L/R colors eventually, so if you're x2y color neutral, you can pick any color except for white and yellow.
2. **Create a 1x2x3 block on the left:** Hold the two centers on L & R. Create a 1x2x3 block on the left side of the cube, as if it was a 3x3. For that, you can all moves except for moves that turn the two equator slices.
3. **Solve the remaining centers:** Solve the remaining four centers while respecting their correct order. For that you can use the RrUl moveset.
4. **Pair the edges:** Hold the 1x2x3 on the bottom in the back. Then, pair the edge that will eventually belong into DB and place it into FD. Then you can restore the centers. Now you can use any method of pairing up the edges. For 4x4, I'd recomment 3-2-3 edge pairing while for all bigger cubes you should use Freeslice.
5. **Solve the DF and DB edges:** Hold the 1x2x3 on the left at the bottom again and solve the DF and DB edges normally.
6. **Solve the dBR pair:** Solve the dBR pair.
7. **OLL parity:** Check during EO recognition if you have OLL parity and correct it immediately.
8. **Solve the cube:** Solve the cube normally and do PLL parity at the end / before ZBLL if required.
