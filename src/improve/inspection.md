# Inspection
Inspection is really important in order to achieve a high turning speed during 2x2x3 and dBR pair.
## How far should I inspect?
At an intermediate level, you should be able to inspect the 1x2x3. As you get quicker, you should start looking for the DFDB edges and try to predict where they are after you create the 1x2x3. Eventually you should inspect solving the whole 2x2x3 and maybe even the pair or the rough position of its pieces.
## How can I train inspection?
Just inspect one step/sub-step more than you are comfortable with in speedsolves, no matter how long it takes you. It is okay if you take multiple minutes to inspect the 1x2x3 at the start, you will only improve at inspection if you train inspecting more a lot.
## Executing the inspected moves
After you've started the solve, try executing the inspected moves as fast as possible. It is one thing to inspect your whole 2x2x3 solution, but to fully take advantage of your planning, you should turn at your fastest. You might want to slow down a little in order to track the pieces for the next step, but with training, you won't have to decrease your turning speed that much for that.
