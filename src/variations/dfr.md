# dFR pair
<image class="right" alt="Rubik's Cube with the EO step completed but with dFR pair instead of dBR pair" src="/images/variations/dfr/dfr.png">

After having completed the 2x2x3 block, you can opt to solve the dFR pair instead of the dBR pair. Generally, you should not do this due to the more difficult recognition for the following EO and LXS steps. Having the dBR slot occupied eliminates a blind spot. Therefore you should really only use dFR pair if it is already solved or a really easy case and you already have recognised it. Don't pause to check if the dFR pair is better, only do it when you recognise it during 2x2x3.

## Algorithms
For dFR pair, you obviously need to use different algorithms for LXS and EO. Most of the cases are just the mirrored version of the dBR pair algorithms.

<div class="warning"><b>Difference between dbR, dBR, dfR & dFR:</b><br>These letters always describe the pieces in the overlap between the moves. dBR refers to the pieces in the <b>B</b>ack-<b>R</b>ight in the <b>d</b>-layers (= back-right F2L pair). The capitalisation matters here! For our purpose dBR and dfR refers to the same thing: dFR is the front-right pair and dbR are the pieces solved during LXS when the front-right pair is solved.</div>
